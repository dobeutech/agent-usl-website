## KNOWN ISSUES
- Missing Supabase environment variables (VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
  * Impact: Database operations will fail, form submissions won't persist
  * Workaround: App loads with placeholder values, but backend features won't work
- Missing translation keys for accessibility features
  * Impact: Some accessibility control labels show key names instead of translated text
  * Affected keys: accessibility.title, accessibility.description, accessibility.fontSize, etc.

## NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION
- 10/40 features are now passing
- Need to set up .env file with Supabase credentials for database testing
- Admin dashboard features (feat-009 to feat-015) require Supabase auth
- Integration features (feat-024 to feat-026) require working Supabase connection
- Consider adding missing translation keys for accessibility controls
- Form submission features need backend connectivity to fully test
